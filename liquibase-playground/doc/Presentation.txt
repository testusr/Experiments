What is Liquibase ?
- Open Source (free!) database change and deployment solution
- Helping with managing database migration sets
  - ensuring every change set is applied and nothing gets forgotten
  - automatically keeping track of whats done and whats not
  - supports grouping of change sets by labels or xml file hierarchy -> simplifying the management of db migrations
    for different release version
  - consistent repeatable results on several environments and different databases
  - supporting rollbacks of change sets
  - conditional execution of changesets (environment specific migrations, deal with manual migrations)
  - simple to integrate and simple to use / maven plugin / spring-boot integration

What is it doing for us ?
  - possibility of automatic change set deployment to each environment
  - the code change and the database change are committed together and can
    be released together from the build process (changes required)
  - it keeps all environments in sync, no forgotten changes or specific
    changes that could not be applied to another environment (if wished)


Enough talking ... how does it look like
(used docker to not mess up my environment)
- show simple migration command / in memory DB
- show structure of change log
- show the structure of the change set
  - show native sql and liquibase language


- show rollback
- provoke an error, show mark as run

- run against sybase
- fix issue with environment specific sql



Could be used to create a minimal DB as basis for tests
- accounts, instruments ...
- could be used to rollback after running tests
- migrations can be tested on a in memory db
